THE IDEA

A machinist hammer is a required tool when machining, it also is a very simple project and as such was my first real project on my mini lathe.

PROJECT GOALS

For this project, I wanted to learn many basic lathe skills quickly and effieiently, I learned facing, turningm single point threadingm tapping, and how to take accurate measurements.

MATERIALS

Starting off this project I knew that I would need 3 items, 3/4 inch aluminium round stock, 1 inch aluminium round stock and 1 inch brass round stock.


BUILDING THE PROJECT

Flowwing Blondihacks i first made the handle, then the top of the hammer and lastly the two face plates.
